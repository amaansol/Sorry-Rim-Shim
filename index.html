        I know I made mistakes, and I wish I could undo the pain I caused. What I can do is promise 
        to love you better, to listen more, and to never take you for granted again. You mean the world to me, 
        and not a moment goes by that I don’t think of you.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you'll give me a chance, I want to make it right. Not just today, but every day. Because losing you is something 
        I don’t want to face. I miss you, Rimsha.
